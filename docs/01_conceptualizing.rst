Given the uncertainties surrounding intertidal flat evolution under sea-level rise, we develop a method for designing dynamic policy pathways for coastal climate change adaptation in the Wadden Sea. This includes identifying policy options that promote marsh growth, while generating critical information to support informed decision-making and the prioritization of adaptive strategies. 
The process involves the following steps:


#. **Conceptualizing the complex and uncertain problem** Identify key system components and their uncertainty ranges, and build a model that captures essential dynamics, feedbacks, and interactions while remaining parsimonious to ensure interpretability and computational efficiency.
#. **Defining measurable indicators** Building on system understanding, we define a set of indicators to evaluate how policies influence key system dynamics across a range of plausible futures. These indicators also reflect the sensitivity to uncertainties in system parameters, capturing both policy effects and the influence of uncertain drivers on system outcomes.
#. **Assessing policy lifespans and uncertainty of policy tipping points** Temporal indicators enable us to evaluate when and how likely a policy is to fail under different future conditions. By explicitly linking policy tipping thresholds to the trajectories of uncertain system components, we can identify critical time windows (criticality bounds) for adaptation and assess the robustness of policies over time.
#. **Combining policy and sea level thresholds to design condition-based dynamic adaptation pathways** We use sea level rise as a key feature to construct condition-based dynamic adaptation policy pathways, focusing on how changes in this driver influence the timing of policy tipping points. Criticality bounds  and guide adaptive strategies accordingly. The criticality bounds guide prioritization of actions by identifying the timing and likelihood of emerging risks, ensuring a focus on the most urgent adaptation needs.




We begin by identifying key system components and their uncertainty ranges, constructing a model that captures essential dynamics, feedbacks, and interactions. The model remains parsimonious to ensure interpretability and computational efficiency.
