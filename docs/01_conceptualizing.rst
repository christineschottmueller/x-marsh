Conceptualizing the Complex and Uncertain Problem
=================================================

We begin by identifying key system components and their uncertainty ranges, constructing a model that captures essential dynamics, feedbacks, and interactions. The model remains parsimonious to ensure interpretability and computational efficiency.
