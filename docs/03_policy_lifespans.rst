Assessing Policy Lifespans and Uncertainty of Policy Tipping Points
==================================================================

Temporal indicators enable us to evaluate when and how likely a policy is to fail under different future conditions. By explicitly linking policy tipping thresholds to the trajectories of uncertain system components, we identify critical time windows (criticality bounds) for adaptation and assess the robustness of policies over time.
