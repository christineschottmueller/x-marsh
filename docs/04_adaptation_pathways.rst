Combining Policy and Sea-Level Thresholds to Design Condition-Based Dynamic Adaptation Pathways
===============================================================================================

We use sea-level rise as a key driver to construct condition-based dynamic adaptation policy pathways. By focusing on how changes in sea level influence the timing of policy tipping points, we identify criticality bounds that guide prioritization of actions. This approach ensures that adaptation strategies focus on the most urgent and time-sensitive risks.
